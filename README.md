BOUNCE - game created by Piotr Goldys
___________________________________________


I created this game in order to utilize freshly learned Python GUI creating skills and threading.
For the graphical user interface I used TKinter module.


At first this was supposed to be small, 100-ish line, single-file project, but turned out a little bigger than expected.
I should have written it with that in mind from the beginning, the final code would be much clearer.

I wrote this project before I read "Clean Code" book - now I would write it in much more clean and intuitive way, 
especially when it comes to naming functions.
